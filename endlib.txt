The Story of Xyzzilaus
   by rudy

A long time ago, in a place called market, there lived a(n) dragon who was called Xyzzilaus.
(His full name was Xyzzilaus the green.)
He was only a poor, old teacher. One day at his job, Xyzzilaus said,'Holy Moly!! I don't want this job anymore!'
'It pays only $1234 a week, and that's not enough! I quit!'

Xyzzilaus started looking for a new job. When he wasn't actively searching, he was slacking at home, eating sour pizza wearing nothing but his sock.
Then he finally found a job! He became a(n) engineer!
For the first few centuries, he really loved his new, tall job.
Then his boss locked him in the basement.

Xyzzilaus stayed in the basement for many milliseconds.
Then he figured out how to escape from his gigantic prison.
He would take a(n) computer and throw it at the window.
Then he'd climb up, open the window, and jump out!
He would finally be able to go back to his car!

However, the building was 98767 stories high, so when Xyzzilaus jumped out the window, he fell to the ground and broke his left.
